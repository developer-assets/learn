This project mainly focuses on color manipulation using CSS
We have four ways of representing colors in CSS

Using the normal color naming
      color: black;
      
Using RGB() values, RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. Each value take a number between 0 - 255. The values represent the intensity of the colors
      color: rgb(0, 0, 0); - This will show black
      color: rgb(255, 255, 255); - This will show white

Using HSL() values, HSL stands for hue, saturation, lighting. Hue takes a value from 0 to 360. Saturation and lighting takes percentage from 0% - 100%
